## Preparation

### Create [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account

Before building our blog site, we need to register a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. The account username is very important, which is the domain address of our blog site.

For example, if we create an account with the username guangzhengli, we will get our blog site which address is https://guangzhengli.github.io.

### Create repository for GitHub Pages

You can find the full tutorial in the [GitHub Pages Doc](https://pages.github.com/). It just need [create a new repository](https://github.com/new) with the repository name  `username.github.io`.

## Build blog

You can clone the repository, which is ready for build and deploy [hugo-ladder-exampleSite](https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite).

```shell
git clone https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite.git
```

After pulling the repository code, we need to modify the configuration, which in the `config.yml` file at the root directory, we need to change all default configs to our custom configs.

### modify configration file

Open the  `config.yml` file in the root directory with an editor and change the configuration as follows: 

```yml
baseURL: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' # set https://username.github.io
homepage: 'https://hugo-ladder.pages.dev' # set https://username.github.io
defaultContentLanguage: 'en' #default language
params:
  brand: HOME # set the brand of your site
  avatarURL: /images/avatar.png # avatar, replace your avatar in the /static/images/
  author: Hugo Ladder # name
  authorDescription: # description
  info:  this is a info # information of your blog site
  favicon: /images/avatar.png # blog site iconï¼Œreplace your avatar in the /static/images/
  options:
    showDarkMode: true # is show dark mode button
    enableMultiLang: true # is show multi language button
```

### Annotate comment-related functions

The repository [hugo-ladder-exampleSite](https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite) just for quickly start. Suppose we all use the same comment configurations. In that case, it will bring some trouble to the subsequent visitor use, so annotating comment-related functions will be better.

change the configuration as follows: 

```yml
comments:
    giscus:
      enable: true
```

to

```yml
comments:
    giscus:
      enable: false
```

## How to create or update posts

You can find the ExampleSite demo article in the `content/blog` at the root directory. You can create a new `markdown` file to add a new article.

Currently in the article header, these tags need to be added to configure the display of the article:

* `title`: article title
* `date`: published date
* `tags`:  tags for articles to search or show
* `series`:  series of articles, it will be show related article in the bottom of article
* `featured`: `true` or  `false`, article will be show in the featured posts in home page if set true.

And you may add the <!--more--> summary divider where you want to split the article.

## Deploy blog

### push your code to username.github.io

In the first step, we create a repository named  `username.github.io`, so you can use the following command to remove the remote URL of the repository [hugo-ladder-exampleSite](https://github.com/guangzhengli/hugo-ladder-exampleSite), and then add your `username.github.io` address to git configuration. **replace `username` with your account username in the following command.**

Finally, you can push your change to the remote repository.

```shell
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git

git add .

git commit -m "feat: init blog site"

git push origin main
```

### Deploy GitHub Pages
Once we've made sure our push is successful, it will automatically build the code in the `Actions`. So you can go to this address to check if  `workflow` is running successfully. replace `username`  with `https://github.com/username/username.github.io/actions`

If `Actions`  runs successfully, we will have a new branch called `gh-pages`. We go to the repository's settings center `Settings`, select `Pages`, and then `Build and deployment` -> `Source` and selects `Deploy from a branch`. After that `Branch` select `gh-pages` to configure successfully.

Select `Visit site` above or manually enter `https://username.github.io` for successful access! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

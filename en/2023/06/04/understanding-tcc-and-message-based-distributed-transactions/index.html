Typically, there are many services, including OrderService, StockService, ProductService. If customer buys some product and create an order, we need to create an order and reduct the stock of these products.\nThe following sequence diagram shows that if everything goes ok, it will create an order and ACID is ensured.\nsequenceDiagram Customer-\u003e\u003e+OrderService: Create an order OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Start transaction Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Transaction started OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Store order Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Order stored OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Reduct stock of product StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Operation succeed OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Commit transaction Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Transaction committed OrderService--\u003e\u003e-Customer: Order created If database or downstream service fails, we can do a simple rollback to database and OrderService, that seems good. But network and hosts maybe unreachable, our rollback maybe lost. So what will happen? Nobody knows, maybe there is no order created, but stock still reduced, this is a terrible thing!\nThe following sequence diagram shows the transaction rollback but the stock reduced, which causes a inconsistency and breaks ACID.\nsequenceDiagram Customer-\u003e\u003e+OrderService: Create an order OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Start transaction Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Transaction started OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Store order Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Order stored OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Reduct stock of product StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Operation succeed OrderService--\u003e\u003eOrderService: Internal operation failed OrderService-x StockService: Rollback OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Rollback transaction Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Transaction rollbacked OrderService--\u003e\u003e-Customer: Order creation failed Solution TCC represents Try-Confirm-Cancel, any resource in distributed transaction should provide three stage:\nTry: Try to allocate resource for future use Confirm: All operation at stage Try are succeed, commit the distributed transaction Cancel: Something wrong, rollback Take the e-commerce order just now as an example, the following sequence diagram shows the whole process in TCC.\nsequenceDiagram Customer-\u003e\u003e+OrderService: Create an order OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Try: Store order Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Order stored alt Successful path OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Try: Reserve some stock StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Stock reserved OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Confirm: Mark stock reduced StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Stock reduced OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Confirm: Modify order status Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Order modified else Failure path OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Try: Reserve some stock StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Stock reserved OrderService-xStockService: Confirm: Mark stock reduced OrderService-\u003e\u003e+StockService: Cancel: Restore stock StockService--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Stock restored OrderService-\u003e\u003e+Order Database: Cancel: Modify order status Order Database--\u003e\u003e-OrderService: Order modified end OrderService--\u003e\u003e-Customer: Order created or failed If everything goes ok, our Try-Confirm will execute successfully, database is consistent, if something fails, our Try-Cancel will handle this situation, database is also consisten. But as mentioned above, network and hosts maybe unreachable, so our commit or rollback will lost.\nGeneral Problems I’ll show some general problems and associated solution with TCC.\nOrder creation with EXECUTING state fails\nLocal transaction will rollback, make sense!\nCall StockService to reverse some stocks fails\nLocal transaction will rollback, and a rollback also send to StockService, StockService can do rollback or do nothing\nCall StockService to reverse some stocks successfully, but reply of StockService lost\nThis will cause Try to timeout, local transaction will rollback and a following rollback will send to StockService, StockService can do rollback.\nTo solve some temporary problem, we can do retry. There are two points we need to considerate when do retry.\nIdempotency\nIdempotency means that no matter how many requests are made, the result is the same as the first successful request.\nFor example, we want to reserve 10 units of a product, no matter how many times we call Try to StockService, finally only 10 units are reserved.\nFor every order, we create a unique id as idempotent key, and send to StockService, so if StockService processed current request, it will simply return the previous result.\nRetry delay\nThere are many delay strategies:\nImmediately retry. Once previous request failed, do a retry immediately, this is not a good choice which may cause downstream service overload Fixed rate retry. Retry with a fixed rate like 10ms. Incremental retry. Every retry will increase delay sequentially, for example, sleep 10ms, 20ms, 30ms Expotential backoff retry. Every retry will increase delay expotentially, for example, sleep 10ms, 20ms, 40ms Special Problems Due to network issue, there are some special problems.\nEmpty Rollback\nTry did not execute, but Cancel executed.\nThe following steps show how empty rollback occurs.\nMake a Try to downstream (packet lost) Transaction rollback, make a Cancel to downstream Downstream receives Cancel The Cancel operaiton of downstream will fail because of no cancellable record found, but if we responses fail to upstream, upstream will do a retry which is a useless operation. So in Empty Rollback situation, we need to response success to upstream and downstream service do nothing to avoid network and compute resource waste.\nHanging transaction\nHanding transaction means because of network issues, Cancel is executed before Try, if not handled properly, may result in inconsistencies.\nThe following steps show how Haning transaction occurs.\nMake a Try to downstream(congested network) Transaction rollback due to timeout of Try, make a Cancel to downstream Downstream receives Cancel, do nothing but respond success Downstream receives Congested Try, reserve resource To solve this problem, downstream service need to record that current transaction was handled(by record transactionId) before reply Cancel call to upstream. Once Try received, check whether the current transaction has been handled.\nWrap Up TCC is a good solution to implement distributed transaction in which there also are some problems. Idempotency and proper Retry make TCC better.\nReference [1] Distributed transaction ","wordCount":"910","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2023-06-04T14:58:33Z","dateModified":"2023-06-04T14:58:33Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lei Xia"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.ddhigh.com/en/2023/06/04/understanding-tcc-and-message-based-distributed-transactions/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lei Xia","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.ddhigh.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script><link rel=icon href=/img/favicon.ico sizes=16x16><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=/img/favicon.ico><link rel=manifest href=/img/favicon.ico><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.staticfile.org/lxgw-wenkai-webfont/1.6.0/style.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/main.min.eb16e2c37edda7bb7b8f844336c65138877ea26f51562d3d69efff7f073bff83.css integrity="sha256-6xbiw37dp7t7j4RDNsZROId+om9RVi09ae//fwc7/4M=" crossorigin=anonymous media=screen><link rel=stylesheet href=/scss/highlight/github-dark.min.min.66034289ee9a113219a2c4aae0a8bd2095ab255c832a42efcf5863f10814e7a1.css><script src=/js/highlight.min.min.c607d6febd16934a82eb61d3a896ed9d869f54373cc63ce95864ed5488fe3128.js></script><script>hljs.highlightAll()</script><script>$darkModeInit.Content|safeJS</script></head><body><main class=wrapper><nav class=navigation><section class=container><a class=navigation-brand href=/en>HOME
